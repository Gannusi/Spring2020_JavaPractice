Practice Topics:
			All the operators
			single if statement
Package name: Practice_03_18_2020
all operators we have learned:
								+, -, *, /, %
								+=, -=, *=, /=, %=
								+, -, --, ++
								>, >=, <, <=, ==, !=,   !, &&, ||
%: numerator - (denominator * Whole Number for result)
	10 / 3 = 3.333333;
	remainder: 10 - (3 * 3)
				10 - 9
				1
post increment/decrement: first passing the current value, and then increase/decrease by 1
					place the operators after the variable name
					int a = 20;
						a++;
pre increment/decrement:  increase/decrease value by 1 immediately
					place the operator before the variable name
					int a = 20;
					++a;
	warm up task:
		write a program that can check the age of a person if he/she is qualified to buy alcohol
		write a code of happiness
|| : as long as one condition is true ==> true
&& : as long as one condition is false ==> false
single if statement:
		if(Condition){
			statements;
		}
